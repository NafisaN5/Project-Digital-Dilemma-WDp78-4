      <h2 style="background-color: #B1C3FF;">Group roles and what we learned</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>Nafisa: Did the digiting actors using CGI article and the css</li>
      <li>Marisa: Did the digitizing DNA article and the css</li>
      <li >David: Did the NBA article and did the borders</li>
    </ul>
    <P> We made a webpage talking about the dilemma that is occuring when it comes to using advanced forms of AI. As a whole we improved our skills on navigating and using CSS and HTML. We also learned more about how people use AI in modern ways. We also learned potientail beneifits of using AI, like being able to bring DNA online and use it to calculate health or even take down criminals, or have an advanced form of CGI to bring actors back from the dead. However, we also learned the potiential risks of these methods, like having your personal data get hacked or having actors potientially lose their jobs over AI. </P>
